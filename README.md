# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction with Ridge Regression Random Forests and Gradient Boosting
In this project, I've trained a machine learning model to predict taxi fares for rides in New York City. The model takes into account details such as pickup date and time, pickup and drop-off locations, and the number of passengers. To achieve this, I utilized algorithms Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. After training the model, I have also submitted the resulting predictions to Kaggle.
